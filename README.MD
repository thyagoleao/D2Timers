# D2Timers

## Introduction

D2Timers is a tool that aims to facilitate the achievement of objectives in DotA 2.
Anyone interested can use it, of course, but it was created with "habit building" in mind for less experienced players. More experienced players should always challenge themselves to improve their skills. So use it sparingly.

## What it is

To be clear: This is not a game cheat! There is no game integration. No one information is captured from your game and no overlays are set on you screen.

This is a standalone app. Its a timer aplication, configured to emit an audible alert on specific game timers (Normal and Turbo Mode are available). You need to interact manualy.



## Downloads

[Github](https://github.com/thyagoleao/d2timers/releases) is the only source where you can get official D2Timers information and downloads.

Download **D2Timers.zip** for Windows in release section. You will find the Linux version in .tar.xz.

## How to use

There is two ways to use this aplication.

Clicking on individual timers or just pressing Auto button.

The "Auto" button starts the timers with pre-defined times to simplify usage. It is the best way to use it. *Tip*: Press "Auto" as soon as your match clock shows 00:00 (recommended).

- **Individual timer interaction:**
  
  - "Left-click": Activate timer in Manual mode.
  
  - "Right-click": Reset the timer to initial state.

- **"Auto"; "Stop"; or "Start" Button:**
  
  - Hotkey: "Spacebar".
  
  - Auto: Starts the timers in Auto mode including the Custom Timer (if time is set).
  
  - Stop: Pauses the timer count.
  
  - Start: Resumes the timer count.

- **"Reset" Button:**
  
  - Hotkey: "R".
  
  - Resets all timers to the initial state.Â 

- **Turbo Mode:**
  
  - Hotkey: "T".
  
  - Set timers for "Turbo Mode".
