# D2Timers

## Introduction

D2Timers is a tool that aims to facilitate the achievement of objectives in DotA 2.
Anyone interested can use it, of course, but it was created with "habit building" in mind for less experienced players. More experienced players should always challenge themselves to improve their skills. So use it sparingly.

## What it is

The app consists of four timers. Each one has a different purpose and will emit an audible alert at the set time. In case the alerts coincide, only the one with the highest priority will be played to avoid confusion and bugs.

## Downloads

[Github](https://github.com/thyagoleao/d2timers/releases) is the only source where you can get official D2Timers information and downloads.

Download **D2Timers.zip** in release section.

## How to use

There is two ways to use this aplication.

Clicking on individual timers or just pressing Auto button.

The "Auto" button starts the timers with pre-defined times to simplify usage. It is the best way to use it. *Tip*: Press "Auto" as soon as your match clock shows 00:00 (recommended).

- **Individual timer interaction:**
  
  - "Left-click": Activate timer in Manual mode.
  
  - "Right-click": Reset the timer to initial state.

- **"Auto"; "Stop"; or "Start" Button:**
  
  - Shortcut key: "Spacebar".
  
  - Auto: Starts the timers in Auto mode including the Custom Timer (if time is set).
  
  - Stop: Pauses the timer count.
  
  - Start: Resumes the timer count.

- **"Reset" Button:**
  
  - Shortcut key: "R".
  
  - Resets all timers to the initial state.Â
